                                    <p class="tet-case">Hi my name is Tonianne and I am the Lifestyle Manager for Fernhill Mercy Health & Aged Care in Sandringham. We have always had pets at our facility and when our Maltese past away I contacted Michaela to see if she had a dog suitable for us.</p>
                                    <p class="tet-case">When Clifford arrived he was a sad and sorry sight. He had flea infested ears, he was very skinny and was a very frightened little fellow. Clifford had been neglected and abused. Well, now Clifford must think he has died and gone to heaven!! He is the most adored, spoilt dog you could ever meet.</p>
                                    <p class="tet-case">Clifford is very protective of our residents; he loves visiting them in their room, hopping up on their laps.</p>
                                    <p class="tet-case">Pet therapy is an essential part of our program. It provides a sense of well-being, a home-like environment for our residents, promotes relaxation and is an outlet for emotional expression.</p>
                                    <p class="tet-case">Clifford is an extremely intelligent dog and fits beautifully into his new home. The only down side to his life, is that our staff are overfeeding him: you know what it’s like they look at you with those sorry eyes and say "Please feed me". And they do, two roast dinners a day!! He’s gone from being an anorexic pup to a butter ball! He is now on a strict diet and is walked 5km every day and is looking good.</p>
                                    <p class="tet-case">As you can see from the photo Clifford has two new playmates and has become very maternal to them. His life is now great!</p>

                                    <p class="tet-case">Benson came into our family by way of The Animal Rehoming Service in 2006. He was renamed from his original as he had issues with it whenever it was spoken. From that moment we knew that we had a special needs dog on our hands. His tough start to life has been a legacy that he has carried throughout and we are still discovering some of the many facets of that beginning.</p>
                                    <p class="tet-case">We didn’t need another animal. Our small townhouse was already home to Tali, another golden retriever, three cats and a rabbit. Each one had been rescued.</p>
                                    <p class="tet-case">It soon became evident the extent that Benson had been beaten and it took a while for him to trust people, particularly men. He is still absolutely terrified of certain sounds that he obviously associates with his old life. One day he was on the front seat of our van when visiting a storage facility. The sound of the roller door sent him rushing into the back of the van, cowering and trembling. How anyone could have been cruel to this handsome and affectionate boy is beyond our comprehension.</p>
                                    <p class="tet-case">There is nothing delicate about Benson or “Boof” as he has been nicknamed, but he is beautiful. He gets along very well with the other furry family members, even allowing the rabbit to jump on his back.</p>
                                    <p class="tet-case">He quickly became the boss of Tali who is much more reserved and indeed, timid in nature but they have formed a strong bond, playing together for hours each day and cuddling together for afternoon naps. He doesn’t like male undesexed dogs so we have to be careful to keep him on his lead at all times but we cope with that and we feel Benson is happier having boundaries. We also ask that people approach him slowly and pat him under his chin so he doesn’t feel threatened by hands approaching the top of his head.</p>
                                    <p class="tet-case">Benson has a great lifestyle including early morning walks down the old stock route in Kensington with his canine friends, Friday night get-togethers with neighbours and Saturday morning shopping at the Queen Victoria Market, where he has his group of regular admirers who he entertains with his teddy bear impersonations. We love Benson a lot and adopting him was a great decision. He craves affection more than any animal we have ever known and he deserves every bit of love that he gets.</p>

                                    <p class="tet-case">Ashleah was six at the time I adopted her. Her previous owners decided that Ashleah would be better off in a single cat household, as she kept fighting the other cats in their home.</p>
                                    <p class="tet-case">The first two weeks for any new owner are a roller coaster of emotions. Ashleah wouldn't have anything to do with me during this period and stayed hidden under the bed in the spare room. Once she decided that she was "home", we started to build up a great relationship.</p>
                                    <p class="tet-case">Now, when I come home from work, I can't wait to see her. She's brought down my stress levels enormously, as being with her allows me to focus on her so my working day is forgotten.</p>

                                    <p class="tet-case">Bessie Belle, our adopted Border Colllie, made her way into our family via The Animal Rehoming Service in July 2006. I saw Bessie’s photo and immediately knew I had to help find her a home.</p>
                                    <p class="tet-case">We already had two dogs; Sam, a Kelpie X Labrador who was nearly 16 years old and Daisy, a 7 year old Labrador.</p>
                                    <p class="tet-case">On her arrival, Bessie had a few health problems, but she is well and truly over them now.</p>
                                    <p class="tet-case">Some time after we adopted Bessie we found out a little about her background and this made us even more pleased that we took her on. It was rumoured she came from a farm where she had to fend for herself. She had been picked up by the ranger probably after falling or jumping off the back of a ute. Nobody wanted her in her bedraggled and depressed state and she was going to be put down.</p>
                                    <p class="tet-case">Bessie is now a different dog. From a dog that shied away from human contact, she’s now first in line for pats and cuddles, sometimes even initiating contact. From a dog who didn’t know about “treats” to a dog who is now a connoisseur of food. She has especially bonded with our son. She really has adopted Matthew.</p>
                                    <p class="tet-case">Bessie loves her Saturday morning “coffee” where we go and meet other dog people. She now interacts with our neighbours on regular Friday night get togethers. She now has her special “beds”. An animal print dog bed, two leather chairs and leather couch in the lounge room and another leather settee in the sitting room, not to mention a dog bed in the backyard and a mat in the conservatory. She certainly had made herself at home.</p>
                                    <p class="tet-case">We are so glad we have Bessie in our home. Although an older dog, we hope we will have her for some time to come.</p>
